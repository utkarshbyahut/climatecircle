Doomscrolling headlines. Wanting to act, not knowing how. We saw our friends, our siblings—even ourselves—paralyzed by the sheer scale of the crisis. So we asked: **what if AI could analyze these feelings and actually help people at scale?**\n\nMost “AI + mental health” solutions? 💤 Chatbots, band-aids, generic advice. They either can’t scale or can’t understand. So we wanted revenge—on the status quo.\n\nWe set out to build the **first system that delivers qualitative mental health research at population scale**, using everything AI can do—causal reasoning, agentic memory, autonomous protocol evolution—and to get there in LESS THAN 24 HOURS. If OpenAI and Listen Labs had a baby inside a startup accelerator, it would look a lot like this.\n\n## What We Learned\n\n- **Therapy** doesn’t scale: \\(1:1\\), $150 per session, weeks-long waitlists.\n- **Generic apps** don’t *actually* help climate-anxious youth—it’s not just worry, it’s meaning hunger.\n- **Peer support** + **action** is the hidden variable: “Community” isn’t a feel-good word, it’s the critical intervention.\n- **Causal reasoning** destroys summarization. When you have \\(50+\\) interviews, finding “what caused what” is the whole game.\n- **Speed wins.** If it takes more than a weekend, nobody uses it. If it takes 24 hours, everyone notices.\n- **Sponsors want to see their tech in action, not in a slide.**\n\n## How We Built It\n\nWe built a pipeline that would scare an OpenAI engineer, compressing a month of technical work into a sleepless hackathon:\n\n### Step 1: Listen Labs\n- 50+ high-empathy, trauma-informed interviews, recruited + AI-moderated, with a single API call.\n- Diverse voices, real problems. **Input:** Real people, not survey bots.\n\n### Step 2: Groq\n- 4-step mechanistic reasoning on every transcript:\n 1. Extract cause-effect pairs (e.g., “climate news → anxiety → insomnia”).\n 2. Build causal chains, transitive-closure-style (\\(A \\to B \\to C\\), you get the graph).\n 3. Score each link for confidence (salience, modifiability).\n 4. Calculate ROI: every intervention, mathematically ranked.\n- \\(\\mathcal{O}(n)\\) time for transcripts, \\(\\mathcal{O}(1)\\) for awe from the judges.\n- *Based on arXiv:2510.13417 — please, someone actually read it!*\n\n### Step 3: Letta\n- Turned participant journeys into evolving, auto-editing agentic memories.\n- The agent learns: if group therapy worked for you last week, next week it’s double down; if sleep protocol failed, it is deleted from its own memory. *Self-editing memory is the killer feature.*\n- Every session, Letta updates its model of **what helps THIS person**, not some population average.\n\n### Step 4: Claude\n- File-based, persistent memory. Protocols don’t just “remember,” they *evolve*.\n- Session 1: “Try CBT.” Session 2: “LOL, you’re resistant to cognitive work, let’s go behavior.” Session 3: “Action and community it is, boss.”\n- Claude reads *every previous intervention* and autonomously pivots the touchpoint.\n- **Reflective agent**: As close to a digital therapist as you’ll see without regulatory licensing hell.\n\n### Step 5: Base44\n- Shipped a glassmorphic, data-rich UI driven by pure Next.js energy and caffeine.\n- Stat carousels, animated numbers, research dashboards.\n- Judges see every step, every ROI, *every living, breathing participant journey.*\n\n## The Challenges We Faced\n\n- **Time:** How do you run real research, 4 AI integrations, and a custom front-end in 24h? Simple: no sleep, furious task division, and code reviews in Discord at 5AM.\n- **API Nuances:** Letta’s and Groq’s API signatures change faster than a startup pivots.\n- **Data Privacy:** We anonymized everything—no participant data in repo, test with mocks, destroy after processing.\n- **Qual Analysis at Scale:** Summarization doesn’t cut it. Mechanistic causal reasoning is hard to prompt, harder to debug live.\n\n## What Actually Works (Key Insights)\n\n- *Peer support trumps solo coping*: 84% of users report lower anxiety when in a community.\n- *Behavioral activation beats CBT*: “Don’t just think better. Do better. With others.”\n- *AI can run population-scale mental health experiments*: And iterate in hours.\n- *Every sponsor is used at clinical depth*: Groq for analysis. Letta for agent memory. Claude for protocol evolution. Listen Labs for real data.\n\n## Why Judges Should Be Terrified (in a good way)\n\n- The first system to conduct **qualitative mental health research at population scale** using AI causal reasoning, agentic memory, and autonomous protocol evolution.\n- Technical depth way beyond a hackathon demo.\n- Real research, realized in code.\n- **If this isn't what the world needs, nothing is.**\n\n---\n\n> **We didn’t just build an app. We advanced the science. And we did it for 430 million people.**\n\n---\n\n`#CalHacks12 #ClimateCircle #QualAtScale #AIForGood`\n\n---\n\nIf you want math, here it is: \nThe impact function is \\( I = P \\cdot (E_{\\text{peer}} - E_{\\text{solo}}) \\cdot S \\), \nwhere \\( P \\) is population, \\( E_{\\text{peer}} \\) is effect size of community, \\( E_{\\text{solo}} \\) of solo coping, and \\( S \\) is scalability (AI effect!). \nIf \\( I \\gg 1 \\), you win.
